We all know math number black hole(maybe..).
Whatever,let me introduce it.

If a number like 845, it is made use of 8,4,5.
Let us recreate a new number by these numbers.
The biggest is 854 ,the smallest is 458.
Minus them,and we get 397.

Then continue above steps.
We get 594.
Go on,we get 495.
If we go on,we can only repeat 9,5,4 three numbers.
WE CALL THESE NUMBER AS math number black holes.
(Well,if there are some wrong with my talking when you search the Internet,just ignore it.
Because I also find some differences with my introduction to others.
Haha anyway,this's just a small exercise.So be free.:)
Come back.
There is a similar black hole in 4 numbers of number. It's 7 6 4 1.
Change different numbers of numbers we can get different holes,and change different systems cna do it too I think.（like BIN,OCT,HEX and so on）
So I do this project to search similar black holes.
