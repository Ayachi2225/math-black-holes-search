We all know math number black hole(maybe..).
Whatever,let me introduce it.

If a number like 845, it is made use of 8,4,5
Let us recreate a new number by these numbers
The biggest is 854 ,the smallest is 458
Minus them,and we get 397

Then continue above steps.
We get 594.
Go on,we get 495.
If we go on,we can only repeat 9,5,4 three numbers.
WE CALL THESE NUMBER AS math number black holes.
(Well,if there are some wrong with my talking when you search,just ignore it.
Because I also find some difference with my introduction.
However,this's just a small exercise.So be free.)
Come back.
There is a similar black hole in 4 numbers of number. It's 7 6 4 1.
Change different numbers of number we can get different holes,and change different systems cna do it too I think.
So I do this project to search similar black holes.
